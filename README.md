# Hi, I'm Parker!

I'm a computer science student at Oregon State University, graduating in June, 2023. I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2023, before starting a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing this Fall.

### About Me 📄 

I have a strong technical background in multiple disciplines of CS, including work in machine learning ✨ (TensorFlow, SKLearn), data science 🔬 (Pandas, MatPlotLib, SQL, Snowflake, TDV), business informatics 📊 (Domo, Spotfire, Statistica), webdev 💻 (React, Django, Express), as well as various projects in C, C++, and Java. 


### Research 🔬

*My paper "Transposition of Simple Waveforms from Raw Audio with Deep Learning" was recently accepted to EvoMUSART 2023!*

I have worked at the [Soundbendor Lab](https://www.soundbendor.org) for four years, where I was advised by Dr. Patrick Donnelly. My work focused on applying machine learning to sound 🎵 in the time-domain, resulting in one peer-reviewed publication 📄, multiple poster presentations 📰, and winning university awards 🎖️ for my work.

### Projects & Coursework 📚

I am currently working to update my GitHub and personal website to properly demonstrate the skills that I've acquired. Stay tuned for updates.
